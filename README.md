This library contains the core functionality, such as GPIO manipulation and SPI/I2C protocol handling, used by other [Embedded PHP](https://github.com/embedded-php) libraries and projects.

It is very unlikely that you want to use this library as is and likely that you're looking for the [Sensors Library](https://github.com/embedded-php/sensors) or the [Display Library](https://github.com/embedded-php/display) instead.
